# Introduction of Clean Code Book

I can teach you the physics of riding a bicycle. The classic mathematics of it is straightforward, I can give you all the information and the knowledge, but you will still fall down the first time you ride it. This is because acquiring knowledge is not the same as acquiring craftsmanship. The only way to become a craftsman is with practice. The same is true for writing clean code.

Learning to write a clean code is hard work. It requires more than just the knowledge of principles and patterns. You must sweat over it. You must practice it yourself, and watch yourself fails. You must watch other people practice it and fail. You must see them stumble and retrace their steps. You must see them agonize over decisions and see the price they pay for making those decisions. You must see them fight to keep a system clean, to keep it simple. You must see them work hard to make it easy.
